I was recently given the task on one of my projects at work, to implement a new
version of a digital signature solution that we use to get legally binding
signatures" from users. As part of the upgrade process, I had to implement
support for [XMLDSIG](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/).

To my great joy, I discovered that the .NET framework has supported XMLDSIG for
years, but I quickly got into problems and all of the documentation I found
online, including the official MSDN documentation covering the XMLDSIG support
was either lacking or incorrect.


## What is XMLDSIG?
Before I get to the code, and the problems I encountered, I'll briefly explain
the concept of XMLDSIG; [XMLDSIG is an old
standard](http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/WD-xmldsig-core-20000114/) in
Internet years, and is seemingly accepted as the best and easiest way of
digitally signing XML documents.

The signature can distributed in three different variants;

1. [Enveloped signature](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#def-SignatureEnveloped)
   -- the signature is added to the document that was signed.
2. [Enveloping signature](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#def-SignatureEnveloping)
   -- the signature contains the document that was signed.
3. [Detached signature](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#def-SignatureDetached)
   -- the signature is distributed separate from the document that was signed.

The differences are rather subtle, but there are many transformations that can
be applied to the document prior to signing, and only the right combinations
provide valid signatures, and that is one of the problems I encountered with the
[problematic MSDN documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.xml.signedxml.aspx).

## Enveloping != Enveloped
The problem with the MSDN documentation, and virtually every other example of
doing XMLDSIG in .NET, is that they are only based around the "enveloped
signature" variant, even when they tell you they are showing you an example of
the "enveloping signature" variant. Either the authors of the examples have
misunderstood the XMLDSIG specification, or have mistakenly used the word
"enveloping", when they should have used "enveloped."

The problem is that, most, if not all, of the authors tell you they are showing
you an example of the enveloping variant, they are instead using some freakish
hybrid variant, and the only reason the sample actually works, is because they
are combining the enveloped and enveloping variants. Any attempt to validate the
signature without the context of the parent document, will fail.

One approach for generating valid enveloping signatures, is to utilize a
different transform that is designed to work with the enveloping variant. The
transform I ended up using was the
[Exclusive XML Canonicalization](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/)
transform, as it lends itself very well to extracting the enveloped document and
using it in another context.

{
    private const LoadOptions SafeLoadOptions = LoadOptions.PreserveWhitespace;
    private const SaveOptions SafeSaveOptions = SaveOptions.DisableFormatting;


    public static XDocument SignDocument(XDocument originalDocument,
                                         X509Certificate2 certificate)
    {
        if (originalDocument.Root == null) {
            throw new ArgumentException(
                "Invalid XML document; no root element found.", "originalDocument");
        }

        SignedXml signature = GetSignature(originalDocument, certificate);
        XDocument signatureDocument = GetSignedDocument(signature);

        VerifySignature(signatureDocument, certificate);

        return signatureDocument;
    }


    private static SignedXml GetSignature(XNode originalDocument,
                                          X509Certificate2 certificate)
    {
        XmlDocument document = GetXmlDocument(originalDocument);
        if (document.DocumentElement == null) {
            throw new InvalidOperationException(
                "Invalid XML document; no root element found.");
        }

        var signedXml = new SignedXml(document);
        var dataObject = new DataObject("message", "", "", document.DocumentElement);

        signedXml.AddReference(GetSignatureReference());
        signedXml.AddObject(dataObject);
        signedXml.SigningKey = certificate.PrivateKey;
        signedXml.KeyInfo = GetCertificateKeyInfo(certificate);
        signedXml.SignedInfo.CanonicalizationMethod = SignedXml.XmlDsigExcC14NTransformUrl;
        signedXml.ComputeSignature();

        return signedXml;
    }


    private static XmlDocument GetXmlDocument(XNode originalDocument)
    {
        var document = new XmlDocument { PreserveWhitespace = true };
        document.LoadXml(originalDocument.ToString(SafeSaveOptions));

        return document;
    }


    private static Reference GetSignatureReference()
    {
        var signatureReference = new Reference("#message");
        signatureReference.AddTransform(new XmlDsigExcC14NTransform());

        return signatureReference;
    }


    private static KeyInfo GetCertificateKeyInfo(X509Certificate certificate)
    {
        var certificateKeyInfo = new KeyInfo();
        certificateKeyInfo.AddClause(new KeyInfoX509Data(certificate));

        return certificateKeyInfo;
    }


    private static XDocument GetSignedDocument(SignedXml signedXml)
    {
        string signatureXml = signedXml.GetXml().OuterXml;
        XDocument signedDocument = XDocument.Parse(signatureXml, SafeLoadOptions);

        return signedDocument;
    }


    private static void VerifySignature(XNode signedDocument,
                                        X509Certificate2 certificate)
    {
        var document = new XmlDocument { PreserveWhitespace = true };
        document.LoadXml(signedDocument.ToString(SafeSaveOptions));
        if (document.DocumentElement == null) {
            throw new InvalidOperationException(
                "Invalid XML document; no root element found.");
        }

        var signedXml = new SignedXml(document);
        signedXml.LoadXml(document.DocumentElement);
        if (!signedXml.CheckSignature(certificate, true)) {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Signature is invalid.");
        }
    }
}

I had to make another little adjustment to get everything to work correctly, and
that was explicitly setting the canonicalization method. Changing the transform,
also solved another problem I encountered; the inability to reference the object
elements by URI ID, as the default behavior when using the enveloped variant is
to look for elements matching the URI ID within the document being signed,
instead of within the signature.

## But what if I want to use the "enveloped signature" variant?
If you don't want the variant I needed (enveloping), then changing the code
sample above to produce signatures of the enveloped kind, is trivial; first make
sure to remove the following two lines:

~~~ csharp
signedXml.AddObject(dataObject);
signedXml.SignedInfo.CanonicalizationMethod = SignedXml.XmlDsigExcC14NTransformUrl;
~~~

The next step is to change the GetSignatureReference method; we need to replace
the transform implementation with something that is suitable for the enveloped
signature.

~~~ csharp
private static Reference GetSignatureReference()
{
    var signatureReference = new Reference();
    signatureReference.AddTransform(new XmlDsigEnvelopedSignatureTransform());

    return signatureReference;
}
~~~

We also need to add an extra argument to the GetSignedDocument method, so that
we can pass in the original document.

~~~ csharp
private static XDocument GetSignedDocument(XNode originalDocument, SignedXml signedXml)
{
    string signatureXml = signedXml.GetXml().OuterXml;
    XElement signatureElement = XElement.Parse(signatureXml, SafeLoadOptions);
    XDocument signedDocument = XDocument.Load(
        originalDocument.CreateReader(),
        SafeLoadOptions);
    if (signedDocument.Root == null) {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid XML document; no root element found.");
    }

    signedDocument.Root.Add(signatureElement);

    return signedDocument;
}
~~~

If you spot any errors, please let me know, so that there can exist at least one
correct example of using XMLDSIG in the .NET framework.
